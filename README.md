# Pearl-Map: 3D Web Mapping Platform

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

A high-performance, customizable 3D web mapping application built with Clojure and ClojureScript. Renders vector tiles and 3D terrain using MapLibre GL, powered by OpenStreetMap data, featuring a real-time style editor for dynamic visual customization.

## Overview

Pearl-Map delivers an immersive 3D geospatial visualization experience, enabling users to explore, analyze, and present location-based data through an intuitive interface. The platform combines powerful rendering capabilities with advanced customization tools.

## Architecture

### 1. Business Architecture

**Core Value Proposition**
Provide a high-performance, customizable 3D geospatial visualization platform that enables intuitive exploration, analysis, and presentation of location-based data.

**Key Capabilities**
- **3D Map Core Experience**: Fluid navigation (pan, zoom, tilt, rotate), 3D terrain rendering, building extrusion, and custom 3D model integration
- **Dynamic Style Editor**: Real-time visual customization through UI controls and code editor with live preview and theme sharing
- **Data Integration & Visualization**: Seamless OpenStreetMap integration with support for GeoJSON and API-based geodata
- **Analysis & Querying**: Spatial feature querying, measurement tools, and future support for advanced spatial analysis

**User Roles**
- **End Viewer**: Explore pre-configured maps and visualizations
- **Map Editor/Analyst**: Create and customize map views using style editing and data integration tools
- **Administrator**: Manage users, system configuration, and backend services

### 2. Application Architecture

**Architecture Style**: Decoupled frontend-backend architecture

**Frontend (Single-Page Application)**
- **Technology Stack**: ClojureScript, Reagent, re-frame
- **Responsibilities**:
  - UI rendering using React/Reagent components
  - State management through unified app-db
  - Map rendering via MapLibre GL JS
  - Style editing with Monaco Editor integration
  - API communication through HTTP calls

**Backend (API Server)**
- **Technology Stack**: Clojure, Ring, Reitit, Integrant
- **Responsibilities**:
  - RESTful API gateway
  - Business logic and spatial query processing
  - Data access via PostgreSQL/PostGIS with next.jdbc
  - OSM integration and external service proxying

### 4. Development Roadmap

**Phase-Driven Strategy**: Focused on rapid validation, iterative enhancement, and strategic expansion

#### Phase 1: Web Application Foundation (Core MVP)
- **Browser-based SPA**: Full-featured single-page application
- **3D Viewing & Basic Editor**: Core 3D visualization with essential editing capabilities
- **PWA Foundation**: Progressive Web App infrastructure setup

#### Phase 2: Product Enhancement (Enhanced PWA)
- **Offline Support & Installation**: Enable offline usage and app installation
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhance loading speeds and rendering performance
- **Advanced Analysis Tools**: Add sophisticated spatial analysis capabilities

#### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Expansion (Platform Expansion)
- **API-First Platform**: Develop comprehensive API for third-party integration
- **Mobile Hybrid Applications**: Extend to iOS and Android using hybrid approaches
- **Desktop Applications**: Native desktop application versions

**Visual Flow**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3

Each phase builds upon the previous work, ensuring continuous enhancement and expansion of capabilities.

## Conclusion

This development strategy follows a low-risk, high-iteration-speed approach. Each phase builds upon previous work, maximizing code reuse and leveraging the full potential of the Clojure/Script ecosystem. The hybrid mobile approach in Phase 3 provides the most efficient path to cross-platform presence.
